<h1>Paragraphs</h1>
<p> A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
    Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. 
    his is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the 
    reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

 <h2>Digital</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples 
    or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a 
    series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects.
    Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most
    important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
